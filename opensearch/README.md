title: OpenSearch
---

An OpenSearch plugin that sets up an OpenSearch environment using the OpenSearch Operator to automate deployment, provisioning, management, and orchestration of OpenSearch clusters and dashboards.
It functions as the backend for logs gathered by collectors such as the OpenTelemetry collectors, enabling storage and visualization of logs for Greenhouse-onboarded Kubernetes clusters.
