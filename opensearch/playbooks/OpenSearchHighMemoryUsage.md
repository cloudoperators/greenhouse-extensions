# OpenSearchHighMemoryUsage

## Problem

The OpenSearch cluster is experiencing high memory usage, which can lead to performance degradation, out-of-memory errors, and potential service unavailability.

## Impact

- Reduced cluster performance and response times
- Potential out-of-memory errors and pod restarts
- Service degradation for applications depending on the cluster
- Risk of cluster instability if memory usage remains high

## Diagnosis

1. **Check memory usage metrics**: Monitor memory usage across all nodes in the cluster:
   ```bash
   kubectl top pods -n opensearch-logs
   ```

2. **Check cluster health**: Verify if the cluster is in a healthy state:
   ```bash
   curl -u $USER:$PW http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
   ```

3. **Check JVM heap usage**: Monitor JVM heap usage for OpenSearch nodes:
   ```bash
   curl -u $USER:$PW http://localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/jvm
   ```

4. **Check for memory-intensive operations**: Look for operations that consume high memory:
   - Large aggregations
   - Complex search queries
   - Bulk indexing operations
   - Index recovery operations

## Resolution Steps

1. **Identify memory-intensive processes**: Check which operations are consuming high memory:
   ```bash
   curl -u $USER:$PW http://localhost:9200/_nodes/stats/jvm
   ```

2. **Optimize queries and aggregations**: If high memory is due to complex operations:
   - Review and optimize search queries
   - Break down large aggregations
   - Use pagination for large result sets
   - Implement proper indexing strategies

3. **Adjust JVM heap settings**: If memory usage is consistently high:
   - Review and adjust JVM heap settings
   - Consider increasing heap size if resources allow
   - Monitor heap usage patterns

4. **Scale cluster resources**: If memory usage is consistently high:
   - Add more nodes to the cluster
   - Increase memory limits for existing nodes
   - Consider horizontal scaling

5. **Monitor and adjust**: Continue monitoring memory usage and adjust resources as needed.

6. **Contact support**: If issues persist, investigate further or seek assistance from your operations team.
