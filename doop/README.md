title: Decentralized Observer of Policies (Violations)
---

This directory contains the Greenhouse plugin for the Decentralized Observer of Policies (DOOP).

# DOOP

To perform automatic validations on Kubernetes objects, we run a deployment of OPA Gatekeeper in each cluster.
This dashboard aggregates all policy violations reported by those Gatekeeper instances.
